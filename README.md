## The Purpose Of This Add-on:
I created this add-on for educators. Technology are being used more often in class, yet educators still need to produce evidence of their classes work. Some teachers opt for generating QR codes for their classes work(stored in their Drive), this way evidence can be viewed through scanning the code. If you are fimilar with some educational software; from my experience this add-on is being used mainly with apps such as Explain Everything and Google Classroom.
